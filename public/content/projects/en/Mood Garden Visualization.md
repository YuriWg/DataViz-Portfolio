## Project Background

The Mood Garden Visualization project is an interactive data visualization experiment based on D3.js, aimed at transforming abstract emotional data into intuitive visual expressions. Each flower represents a day's mood record, with the size and color of the flower reflecting the level of mood index. It supports two viewing modes: random layout and calendar layout, and provides multiple theme color switching options.

## Features

- Transform mood data into aesthetically pleasing flower visualizations
- Support for both random layout and calendar layout modes
- Provide multiple theme color switching options
- Flower size and color reflect mood index
- Interactive data browsing and filtering functions

## Technical Implementation

The project not only implements data visualization but also focuses on user experience and interactivity. Built with React and D3.js, it helps users better understand and analyze their emotional change trends. Through custom SVG graphics and animation effects, it creates a visually appealing experience.
