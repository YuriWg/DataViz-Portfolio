## Project Background

This project is a visual exploration of the life and works of Swiss surrealist artist H.R. Giger. Giger is known for his "biomechanical" style and won an Oscar for his visual design in the movie "Alien." Through data visualization, this project presents the creative journey and evolution of this unique artist's style.

## Features

- Artist's life timeline and key events
- Analysis of work styles and thematic evolution
- Visualization of media usage and technical development
- Analysis of influence on popular culture
- Visual deconstruction of artistic style characteristics

## Technical Implementation

Created with Tableau, this project combines data analysis with art appreciation. Through carefully designed visual elements and layouts, it creates a dark aesthetic atmosphere that matches Giger's artistic style. The project not only displays statistical analysis of art data but also pays tribute to this great artist's creative style through visual design elements, providing an immersive experience of data and art fusion for the audience.
