## Project Background

The Exchange Rate Changes project is a visualization analysis of the trends in exchange rates of major global currencies. Through historical exchange rate data, it shows the fluctuations and changes in currency values during different periods, helping audiences understand the economic and political factors behind exchange rates.

## Features

- Historical exchange rate trend charts for major currency pairs
- Analysis of the correlation between exchange rate fluctuations and major economic events
- Comparative views of strength changes in different currencies
- Exchange rate prediction trend analysis
- Interactive time filtering and currency comparison functions

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using Tableau, transforming complex currency exchange rate data into intuitive visualization charts through various chart types and interactive functions. Through time series analysis and comparative views, it helps users identify long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, better understanding the dynamic changes in global financial markets.
