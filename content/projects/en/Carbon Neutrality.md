## Project Background

The Carbon Neutrality project is a data visualization analysis focusing on the current status and development of global carbon emissions and carbon neutrality policies. By collecting and analyzing carbon emission data from various countries, this project explores possible pathways and challenges to achieving carbon neutrality goals.

## Features

- Comparison and analysis of carbon emission data from countries worldwide
- Visualization of carbon neutrality policy timelines and targets
- Analysis of carbon emission contributions from different industries
- Assessment of the potential of emission reduction technologies and measures
- Interactive data filtering and comparison functions

## Technical Implementation

A multi-view dashboard created with Tableau, combining maps, time series charts, and comparative analysis to comprehensively display data insights related to carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. Through data visualization, complex environmental policies and scientific data become more intuitive and easy to understand.
